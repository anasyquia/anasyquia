## Hi there 👋 I'm Ana!
I'm a recent graduate of the M.S. in Applied Data Science program at the University of Chicago, with experience building large-scale analytics and machine learning systems. I love turning messy, real-world data into clear insights and practical solutions.

### What I work on
- ***Large-scale analytics & ML:*** forecasting, classification, clustering, anomaly detection
- ***NLP & multimodal systems:*** BERTopic, RAG pipelines, CLIP + FAISS retrieval
- ***Distributed data:*** PySpark, GCP, AWS
- ***Data storytelling:*** dashboards, executive insights, decision-support tools

### Featured Projects
*Note: Some projects are not public due to confidentiality — happy to discuss if you'd like to learn more.*
- ***Hierarchical Forecasting System (Capstone):*** Predicted demand across 45K+ time series; enabled ~$3M projected annual impact
- ***Amazon Review Fraud Detection:*** PySpark + MinHashLSH pipeline to detect AI-generated & near-duplicate reviews across 75GB of data
- ***Multimodal Product Search:*** Sub-second CLIP + FAISS retrieval system for text–image search
- ***News Analytics & Trend Detection:*** Analyzed 200K+ articles to uncover industry shifts using BERTopic & transformer embeddings

(More projects coming soon—actively updating!)

### Technical Skills
Python, SQL, R, PySpark, GCP, AWS, Streamlit, Tableau, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Hugging Face, LangChain, FAISS, MinHashLSH, RAG pipelines, Jupyter

### About Me
I previously worked in developmental cardiac biology, oncology care, and cancer immunotherapy research. Now, I’m excited to apply data science to meaningful real-world problems in tech, healthcare, and mission-driven organizations.
